python-rhsm is a small Python wrapper for making REST calls to a Red Hat
Unified Entitlement Platform. For such an example, see the Candlepin project:

To use, create an rhsm.connection.UEPConnection object and examine the methods
it provides. The vast majority of what this library offers is on this class.
